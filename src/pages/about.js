      <b> Hello</b>

        <p > Iâ€™m Kai Detmers, a digital designer and programmer living in Bremen, Germany. Digital Media was my passion ever since I got my first computer when I was six. A new world opened and semed to open door after door during the years, VR, AI or now AR. That is what I love about the industry, it is ever changing. To keep up with the industry (and my biggest hooby), I listen to audiobooks or podcasts and simply meeting likeminded people on conferences. I would love to get in touch with you to talk about digital media topics.  </p>

        <p ><b> I love Virtual Reality</b>
          <br />

When the first Oculus Rift came out, I was among the first who backed it on Kickstarter. Now I own a Facebook Group about mobile VR with around 3.000 members. Albeit being a rather small community and the hype dying down, I see it as the future of computing. </p>
